# ECE1786
Repository for ECE1786 Course Project Fall 2023, and ECE1786 Assignments.

Project branch:
Code and some samples of original data. All code to be run on Google Colab, with Drive locations mentioned as where Drive is mounted. Not included here is the
official 9/11 commission report which we use for background. It can be found at https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf. The document is too large
to upload here. Saved model files are not included either due to size of files.

Assignment branch:
Submitted code for each assignment.
